# rkcode coding tutorials!
### these coding tutorials start with c++. I will add a python tutorial later but for now enjoy the tutorial!

### 3. how to use the print function
## introduction for c++
### Welcome to the world of c++! a coding language used for game development, web development, and so much more! Any electronic computer has code, most of it being c++ so it is a great language to learn. Being brutally honest, c++ is a very hard language to learn for begginers but stick to it and TRUST ME you WILL get it! The mos important takeway is don't get discouraged, every developer had to go through the stuff you have to get throught to get to an expert level. 
## setup 
## Before you setup! NOTES!
### this tutorial I will be using a tool called arduboy. An arduboy is an 8 bit game console that has a special coding library to assist in learning c++. If you don't have the physical arduboy that is ok we will show you the digital version and how you can use that to code! 
### Lets get your computer all of the tools it needs to make code and run it! First we are going to grab an app that is kind of like google docs that will let us write code. This app is called the arduino IDE and ide stands for an integrated development enviroment. This is an enviroment where you can develop code and work on your game projects.
